Solves [15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) with weighted A* search algorithm.

I wrote it for Artificial Intelligence course in year 2011. The UI is very primitive and inconvenient as I concentrated on the algorithm part.

Documentation, strings and comments are in Estonian. Names of variables, functions and such are in English tho'.
